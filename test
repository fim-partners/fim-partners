# Overview #

## History & Introduction ##
FIM Partners was established in 2008 as among the first dedicated and independent specialist investment managers focused on the Emerging Frontier markets. The firm has successfully navigated the risks of investing in Emerging Frontier markets over the last twelve years through its fundamental approach, on the ground presence and smart portfolio construction. The firm’s flagship equities fund has generated a 170% return since inception and 110% of outperformance against the benchmark.

In addition to employing investment staff with over 200 years combined experience in Emerging & Frontier markets, the firm employs inhouse, independent risk management and operations professionals and its focus on capital preservation has led to its funds having a top ranking in league tables. The firm has cultivated long-term partnerships with institutional investors since inception, and AUM has grown significantly from $140 million in 2010 to $US1.8 billion today. As an independent firm, FIM Partners has been able to establish conservative AUM limits to size its strategies to the opportunity set for alpha generation and has never breached its capacity limits.

# Investment Philosophy #

## Overview ##
FIM Partners’ investment approach is fundamentally based, with the objective of producing uncorrelated, strong returns. We rely heavily on utilizing on the ground research capabilities to provide advantageous access and insight into our markets. ESG is an integral part of the due diligence process and the firm is a signatory to the UNPRI. FIM Partners is a long-term thematic bottom up investor, and we are afforded this approach due to the long-term partnerships we have cultivated with our institutional investor base.

## Value Add and Alpha Generation ##
We believe the solid economic foundations and the inefficient market structures of emerging & frontier market economies provide a unique set of opportunities to capture attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. The different stages of economic development, macro imbalances, business cycles, and political risks across the entire EFM universe, however, warrant an active management approach to investing, and one which should be unconstrained by the indices.

The firm’s alpha generation is sourced from the following competitive advantages:

-* Active engagement within our markets: Our philosophy is built upon cultivating an extensive network of policy makers, economists, academics, industry leaders and wider stakeholders. This ‘on the ground’ presence and active network gives us a competitive advantage over ‘desktop investors’, ensuring we can understand better the structural changes in the markets we invest in
-* Smart Portfolio: Emphasis on portfolio construction as a means to mitigate downside risk and enhance risk adjusted returns over the life of the cycle
-* Team: The team at FIM Partners is one of the most experienced in the EM frontier space, with +20 years average experience at the portfolio manager level. Our footprint is diverse, with investment professionals being native to our markets and having worked across the institutional spectrum: buy side, government international financial institutions, sell-side research, rating agencies and investment banks
-* Capacity Constrained: Our strategy has a clear limit in terms of AUMs, ensuring asset performance takes priority over the level of assets under management
-* ESG Framework: ESG is incorporated as an integral part in its investment due diligence process to ensure that all portfolio investments are compliant with the parameters of our proprietary ESG Framework 

## Investment Philosophy - Public Equities ##
As a bottom up investor, the investment team places emphasis on the portfolio’s secular themes. Broad themes that play into the strategy’s investment thesis include:

- Changes in consumer demographics/habits
- Structural change – government, societal and economic
- Regulatory and legal reform that increase confidence for market participants
- Liberalisation of markets, privatisation, limited government intervention
- Banking reforms to improve confidence in the financial services sector
- Urbanisation and modern retail penetration
- Healthcare spending
- Education privatization

Idea generation is simultaneously achieved through combination of identifying thematic drivers, bottom up security selection and top-down macro screening.

-* Bottom-up thematic approach: As thematic bottom-up investors we seek to position ourselves in secular themes that are developing in our investable universe which for the most part are insulated from global events and are sustainable in the medium term. Once we identify a theme of interest, we apply quantitative & qualitative screens to identify companies that would be best positioned to benefit from the theme playing out. Each country is covered by a primary analyst (country specialist) and supported by a sector specialist. The team short-list companies that stand to benefit from the identified thematic tailwind and that satisfies FIM’s quantitative/qualitative check list.

-* Non-screen idea generation: Ideas are derived from our interactions with our resource network including corporate executives, regulators, government officials, industry experts, consultants and investment bankers in the countries we invest in. These interactions typically occur but are not limited to during our on-ground visits to the countries we invest in. 

-* Top-down macro approach: Country screening is done based on FIM Partners’ proprietary macro scoring, which is derived from in-house macro modeling and by having dialogs with policymakers/senior officials from international organizations (such as IMF, World Bank and embassies). 

## Investment Philosophy – Fixed Income ##
FIM Partners’ investment approach for fixed income rests on three pillars: unconstrained, i.e. not captive to the indices by picking and choosing the best expression of risk across the entire EM universe, fundamentally based, and high conviction. There’s also a strong focus on portfolio construction with the objective of limiting the drawdown risk so inherent of the asset class. Investment themes and ideas are expressed by investing in debt and FX of emerging and frontier markets in both local and hard currency.

As outlined below, our fixed income strategies are broken down into three return streams that establishes a risk mitigating framework designed to reduce the drawdown risk of the portfolio:

-* Income Stream – where we maximize for yield under a (low) volatility target
-* Credit Conviction – where we look for turning points in credit
-* Macro Overlay – where we adjust the portfolio to global risk factors.

{image assets/philosophy-fixed-income.png caption "Investment Philosophy for Fixed Income"}

## Collaboration between Teams ##
FIM Partners is uniquely placed in the emerging & frontier markets as a boutique firm with dedicated teams for both equity and fixed income. The specialised nature of the firm compared to its larger peers allows for free-flowing exchange of information and ideas between the teams and allows for a more wholistic analysis of risk across the capital structure. There is cross sitting in the ICs, with the firm’s CIO and Sovereign Strategist sitting on equity and fixed income ICs, whilst at least one PM from the other team cross sits on IC on a rotating basis.

The teams share macro research (inflation, interest rate projections, FX and other macro indicators) with each other in IC. In addition, joint macro trips are organized, and macro notes and developments are shared daily on the firm’s joint research platform. On the corporate side, access to management and financial models are shared between teams, and the equity team shares insight on the business drivers and models of underlying companies researched. 

## Independent Risk Management ##
Capital preservation is core to the continued success of FIM Partners. We operate an independent inhouse risk management team and have successfully managed the risks of investing in emerging and frontier markets for the last 12 years. FIM Partners has an excellent track record in down markets where our fundamental views re-asset themselves and smart portfolio construction limits downside risk through diversified return streams.

FIM Partners has developed a risk management and corporate governance framework that aims to oversee and manage all investment, operational and business risks impacting the different portfolios. This framework includes, among others, a Risk Committee, chaired by FIM Partners’ Chief Operating Officer, and an Internal Control Committee chaired by FIM Partners’ Chief Legal and Compliance Officer.  The Risk & Controls Manager is responsible for the development and production of risk reports, derived from a proprietary in-house system.

In constructing our portfolio, we seek to create the most efficient portfolio on a risk/reward basis. Our approach is borrowed from the Markowitz portfolio theory and we seek to place our portfolio as close to the efficient frontier as possible. To achieve this goal, we look at the following criteria:

-* Opportunity set: At any point of time, we have a clear idea on what investments can be included in the portfolio. This is reflected in our approved investment list. It contains all the names that fit our investment philosophy. The size of this list is variable and affects the sizing of individual positions 

-* Factor exposures:  We seek, for each investment, to break down the value drivers in terms of separate risk factors. Then, we build our portfolio to minimize exposure to each factor. A new investment providing a new uncorrelated exposure to the portfolio is more likely to be included with a higher weight

-* Catalysts: We favor investments in which we think imminent catalysts will lead to a quick realization of value. All else equal, a new investment would have a higher weight in the portfolio if it has more imminent catalysts.

-* Risk framework: We make sure that our portfolio fit within our risk framework and fulfils the risk limits of the fund or portfolio 

### Risk Limits ###
Risk limits are hard constraints that must be observed other than in exceptional circumstances. Examples of risk limits include concentration limits, duration limits and credit quality limits for fixed income portfolios, specific exposure limits for less liquid or more risky instruments or markets and the ban on dealing in instruments that are not defined within the individual mandates. 

### Risk Flags ###
Risk flags indicate whether Portfolio/Fund Managers are taking large risk positions relative to predefined levels. Risk flags are in place to assist overall risk control at the overall portfolio level and promote discussion with the Risk Team and senior management as to what action should be taken if a portfolio exceeds a flag. Examples of risk flags include VaR increase, liquidity risk, significant position underperformance  and scenario flags. 

### Stress Tests ###
Scenario tests that are designed to capture more extreme moves than the 99% one-day VaR are run every morning and can provide insight into more extreme events at the overall portfolio level. About 10 historical and user defined scenarios are included in these stress tests, and are vital for identifying risk extreme events, given that the portfolios’ P/L profile is non-linear in most cases.

### Liquidity Risk ###
The liquidity of each security is monitored and tested prior to any trade and on ongoing basis. The Investment Team sizes positions in such a way that position risk can be mitigated quickly should liquidity conditions become more difficult. As such, positions are sized according to the ability to express the view in a risk-controlled manner. A liquidity risk section is an important part of the Risk Committee.

### Risk Reporting ###
The Investment Team receives daily reports by e-mail detailing the risks in their portfolio including information on VaR utilization, volatility, percentage risk contribution vs percentage weighting, stress tests results and risk sensitivities. Additionally, these reports contain details of where individual risk flag utilisation is greater than 80%. A flash VaR warning e-mail is also sent out every morning in cases where portfolios exceeded VaR flags. To assist in managing VaR exposure the Risk Team utilises the Bloomberg factor models in a way that makes the VaR consistent with portfolio tracking error and volatility, which are computed using the same factor models.

## Corporate Governance Framework ##
The corporate governance framework of FIM Partners is defined by the following committees.

{image assets/corporate-governance.png caption "Governance Committees at FIM Partners}

# ESG #

## Overview ##
FIM Partners provides asset management services to institutional investors globally across several asset classes and investment objectives, all sharing the common aim of generating attractive risk- adjusted returns. FIM Partners is committed to reaching that common goal through an investment approach that incorporates environmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”) factors. FIM Partners is a signatory to the UNPRI.

We believe that ESG issues can indeed affect the long-term performance of investment portfolios and by incorporating ESG analysis as an integral part of our investment process, we are gaining deeper insight into potential latent risks to prospective financial gains and avoid them accordingly. Furthermore, we see ESG as an opportunity to engage our portfolio companies and collaborate with them on implementing best international practices which will lead them to a path of long-term sustainable growth. We utilize internal and external resources to assist us in analyzing ESG issues, engage with companies in which we invest, and when authorized, we exercise proxy votes.

## Our Principles ##
While our overriding duty as mandated by our clients, is to maximize investment returns without undue risk of loss, in our approach to responsible investing, we will favour investee companies that will:

- not have activities in “no-go sectors”
- comply and monitor compliance with all applicable laws
- as appropriate, minimise adverse impacts and enhance positive effects on the environment, workers, and all stakeholders
- commit to continuous improvements with respect to management of the environment, social matters and governance
- work over time to apply relevant international best practice standards
- employ management systems which effectively address ESG risks and realise ESG opportunities as a fundamental part of a company’s value.

## ESG for Public Equities ##
Each investment team member is responsible for conducting the relevant ESG due diligence for their investments with oversight by the Head of Research. Our ESG process is premised on the following pillars:

### Pillar 1 – Exclusion ###
This involves screening for excluded sectors (“Exclusion List”) which are discussed in our Responsible Investment policy. At the same time, we screen companies for serious violations of the Ten Principles of the U.N. Global compact (U.N.G.C), to assess if they have been adequately addressed and the likelihood of a recurring event. We rely on internal research, media reports and the Sustainalytics Controversy alerts tool to assist with this.

### Pillar 2 – ESG Integration ###
This involves a detailed analysis of each prospective investment whereby each prospective investment is vetted through our proprietary ESG scorecard. Scorecard information is derived from public filings (Annual reports, Sustainability reports), management questionnaires which are circulated on an annual basis, and information gleaned from site visits/management meetings. Scorecards are updated on annual basis for existing investments, unless a material event occurs before. The scorecard is not a mere box checking exercise but rather serves several purposes:

- Internally to make sure the investment team has a holistic view of the company when making their investment decision 
- Identifying areas of future engagement 
- Benchmarking the company against regional/global peers, where feasible.

### Pillar 3 – Engagement ###
Engagement is a critical element of our Responsible Investment approach as we see divestment as an action of last resort. Our decade long experience in our investment space has shown that companies are likely to enact meaningful change through constructive dialogue. Our engagements focus on issues that could have a material financial impact with priority given to the top ten holdings of a particular strategy and/or investments facing a material ESG concern. Engagement are conducted through direct engagement and via our proxy voting (discussed in detail in our Responsible Investment Policy).

In terms of specific red flags that we particularly look out for include: (1) Historic violations of the U.N.G.C, (ii) any lawsuits that the company is party to whether it be from employees or third-parties and the frequency of these lawsuits, (iii) Materiality & frequency of accounting restatements, (iv) any reported incidents of working conditions/observations during site visits, (v) level of independent representation on the Board and if the Audit committee is headed by an independent director, (vi) Materiality of related party transactions and the terms at which they are being conducted (vii) Management reputation.

The final product of our ESG scorecard is a numerical score between 0-100 with a score of 50 deemed a passing score (“minimum threshold”). However, the investment team has the discretion to invest in a company that fails to meet the minimum threshold should there be sufficient evidence to show that the company score would improve above the threshold in the near future due to management initiatives.

The Firm has engaged Sustainalytics as a third-party service provider to aid its ESG efforts. We rely on Sustainalytic’s Controversy tool to initially screen our universe whilst also monitoring potential controversies at our existing investments. We also rely on Sustainalytics risk analysis methodologies to glean material sectoral ESG factors in order to strengthen our internal processes. However, we do not rely on Sustainalytics ESG Risk ratings for our portfolio companies as our experience has shown: (i) inconsistency in the ratings across various providers, (ii) Lack of disclosures in our markets could be prejudicial to third-party rating assessments, (iii) Third-party rating providers tend to apply a uniform standard regardless of capital market development, which we feel is not the best approach.

## Impact on Portfolio Construction ##
In terms of investment sizing, investments that fall below the minimum threshold cannot constitute more than 3% of the portfolio at an individual level with weighting increasing subject to improvements in their ESG score within a reasonable time period. While we give deference to the ESG score in assigning portfolio weight, our sizing decision is also a function of other factors including, the nature of the theme we are investing in, liquidity, and probability/timing of the catalyst materializing. Hence the ESG score will be a consideration but not a deciding factor in the respective portfolio sizing. 

## ESG for Fixed Income ##
For investment in fixed income securities and their derivatives, we believe that there are multiple topics that need to be focused on from an ESG perspective.  From the investment team’s background in policy and development economics, there is inherently a strong emphasis on institutional strength and reform orientation, which is endogenized in our assessment of key macro-political credit drivers.  The ESG framework that is applied further strengthens in a quantitative and qualitative way the rigorous country risk assessment conducted with more traditional tools.

FIM Partners uses four data sources which are updated each year, to provide the initial ESG screening for our investible universe.  We weight the three pillars 25% for environmental, 25% for social and 50% for governance. Most importantly, the sources must be time-tested, robust and comprehensive.

{image assets/esg-indicators-fixed-income.png caption "ESG Indicators for Sovereign Risk Assessment"}

### The construction of the ESG Sovereign Scoring Model ###
The firm’s scoring model is comprehensive and simple in methodology. The firm utilizes the following time tested, transparent and well understood indices to measure environment, social and governance for countries in the investment universe. 

1*	Environment Indices (25% weight): The firm relies on the comprehensive Yale Environmental Protection Index (EPI) for environment indicators.  The team at Yale, collaborating with international and domestic partners, produces an aggregate EPI score, which is composed of 24 indicators that are split into 2 broad categories, Ecosystem Vitality (60% weight) and Environmental Health (40%).  The former is to capture the countries resources and resource management while the latter is to capture the impact of policy on human health.

2*	Social Indices (25% weight): The firm utilizes the UNDP’s Human Development Index (HDI) for social indicators. The HDI measures education system and attainment, health, and income.  The UNDP also produces an Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI), which we utilize in our bi-annual ESG review for further analysis of the countries provided.

3*	Governance Indices (50% weight): The firm utilizes the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index (ROLI) and the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey (DBS) for governance indicators, as noted in Figure 8.1. The ROLI is covering such things as fundamental rights, order and security, and civil justice that are social in nature.  The DBS is usually not included in typical ESG metrics, but we find all those things which make business easier to be important markers for governance.

A composite score is created by weighting the four indices (YEPI, HDI, ROLI, DBS) each at 25%, resulting in a 25% weighting for environmental criteria, 25% for social, and 50% for governance (due to the ROLI and DBS being complimentary governance scores).

The score is augmented by additional weighting for the change in the DBS score, to capture the importance of the velocity of change as a result of government policies to improve the business environment in the emerging and frontier space. The DBS index is utilized here as it is most dynamic and easiest to capture government policy responsibility. The resultant country score is ranked across the investment universe. The firm will then exclude the lowest decile from the investment universe, whilst placing countries on the second lowest decile on a higher level of review.

### Active Monitoring ###
Annual surveys, of which are indices are composed, are not sufficient for final investment decisions. At the time of investment and as an ongoing check, we monitor for high frequency ESG indicators. These include monthly and quarterly data on employment and poverty (social indicators) and legislative and regulatory events, ESG-liabilities risk on corporates and climate events and sensitivities that could affect harvests, food price inflation, trade accounts, and social conditions.

Finally, the firm also adheres to the UN Global Compact Principles laid out below. While these are more associated with corporates, we believe government policies must be aligned with them as well.  As our fund invests in corporate bonds, IC discussions incorporate our general ESG framework and company-specific matters as seen through the UN Global Compact Principles.

We also use Sustainalytics for the ESG assessments of corporates and quasi-sovereigns. In addition to the screening provided by these sources and our analytical credit work with ESG embedded, we have an exclusion list based on countries under UN Sanctions and countries in which we do a semi-annual review of conflict/civil unrest and extreme political instability.  This semi-annual screening is facilitated by political risk indices provided by rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch.

# Trading #

## Overview ##
The firm uses the Bloomberg AIM OMS and the Advent Geneva PMS. Through these systems, the front office and back office functions are segregated, and the trade flow is fully automated. 

Bloomberg AIM is utilized by the Front office for portfolio management, including order generation, and for trade execution. Bloomberg AIM is utilized by the Middle Office for compliance and risk restriction monitoring and for post trade confirmation and instruction to the Custodian / PB and Fund Administrator. 

Advent Geneva is utilized by the Back Office to maintain FIM Partners’ shadow accounting records. Reconciliation procedures are performed in Advent Geneva. The system automatically reconciles Geneva to AIM as well as Geneva to the Custodian / PB data. 

In addition, the risk management team and investment team are responsible for monitoring risk metrics daily, using inhouse proprietary risk tools and Bloomberg’s Portfolio and Risk Analytics tool (PORT), both of which use proven risk methodologies (historical value at risk, stress testing, and scenario analysis). PORT provides the tools to understand the structure of the portfolio, analyse the positions and active bets, and explain the drivers of historical performance and potential sources of future risk. 

## Best Execution ##
FIM Partners has in place a Best Execution Policy that ensures optimal transaction conditions and fair treatment to all clients. Under the firm’s Best Execution and Allocation Policy, the following factors are considered to determine the way the orders are executed: 

- Speed
- Likelihood of settlement
- Size of the order
- Costs
- Nature of the order; and 
- Other considerations relevant to the efficient execution of the order

The trader will place trades for execution only with brokers on the firm’s list of approved brokers. The level of importance of such criteria is determined using the following execution criteria:

1. The characteristics of the execution venues (primary issue versus secondary market; in the former case, the issuer’s agent is used or else the broker best placed to offer liquidity; in the latter case the trader will make order enquiries through its network of brokers);
2. The characteristics of the order/financial instrument (for listed securities, the selection of brokers will be made based on price and quantity of stock for each execution)
3. The characteristics of the client (compliance with the client’s investment strategy/restrictions)

## Allocation between Accounts ##
When allocating trades to separate pools the portfolio manager will always act in accordance with the prospectuses of the relevant pools and in the best interest of the investors of each pool. 

FIM Partners will ensure that when allocating transactions between separate pools the allocation is made in a transparent manner in accordance with its trade allocation policy. This will be of importance should only partial fulfilment be achieved, or if any order is executed in a series of trades that have different prices. 

In deciding on the allocation (order size) for each pool, the portfolio manager takes the following into consideration: 

- the investment strategy and objective of the relevant pool; 
- the risk profile of the relevant transaction; 
- the existing risk profile of each pool separately (prior to allocation of the transaction); 
- the impact on the pool’s risk profile as a result of any allocation; 
- the comparable size of the assets under management of the pool; and 
- the comparable size of un-invested cash of the pool. 

In the event that the above criteria in respect of the relevant pools in the reasonable discretion of the portfolio manager are equal, the portfolio manager shall, if possible, allocate the transaction to the pools on a proportional basis. Orders generated for entities which follow a similar strategy are automatically aggregated prior to the trade being created and sent for execution. The operations team monitors whether the final executed trade is allocated in different proportions to the pre- allocated order. If it has been allocated in proportions different to that originally intended, then the Compliance Officer is informed of the trade and the reasons for the allocation change to ensure that any possible conflicts of interest are considered and addressed appropriately. This process applies to orders on both primary and secondary markets.

## Broker Selection Policy ##
Selection of new brokers begins with a proposal from the investment team. Factors considered when selecting new brokers include:

- Quality of execution – accurate and timely execution, clearance and error/dispute resolution
- Reputation, financial strength and stability
- Block trading and block positioning capabilities
- Willingness to execute difficult transactions
- Willingness and ability to commit capital
- Access to underwritten offerings and secondary markets; 
- Ongoing reliability
- Overall costs of a trade (i.e., net price paid or received) including commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs or spreads in the context of FIM Partners’ knowledge of negotiated commission rates currently available and other current transaction costs
- Nature of the security and the available market makers
- Desired timing of the transaction and size of trade
- Confidentiality of trading activity
- Market intelligence regarding trading activity
- The receipt of brokerage or research services

Subsequently, there is a risk, legal/compliance and operational review of any new proposed brokers that rate favorably against the above factors. Considerations include risk profile (credit rating, CDS spreads, share price volatility), financial strength, legal agreements, KYC assessment and operational requirements (e.g. CTM enabled). After final approval, brokers are added to the firm’s list of approved brokers.

All brokers on the list of approved brokers are subjected to a performance review by the firm twice annually. The review takes the form of a scorecard which rates brokers based on the following criteria: 

- Execution: direct execution fee, slippage
- Research: corporate access, corporate depth, quality of analysts
- ECM: deal flow
- Equity sales: quality of coverage
- Balance sheet: CDS, credit rating
- Operations: Post trade service, CTM enabled, settlement cycle

## Trade Errors ##
By definition, a trade error consists of either buying or selling a quantum of securities different from what was intended or buying securities when the intention was to sell – or vice versa. A trading error may become apparent immediately when a trade is placed. Errors may also be identified subsequently by the firm’s operations team as part of any later reconciliations process. The firm may also receive notification of errors from its prime brokers and settlement agents, executing brokers or the client’s administrator.

Under the firm’s Trading Error Policy, where a trading error occurs, it is immediately reported to the COO and the Compliance Officer and recorded in a trading error log. Trading errors that have a value of 1% of the NAV of the relevant portfolio are notified to the board of directors or the managed account client.

The firm’s operational infrastructure has an embedded set of controls to monitor trade activity and identify violations throughout the trade lifecycle. Namely, orders are placed in the system by the PM and passed through the compliance engine before being sent to trader for execution. There are firm-wide rules such as a Fat Finger rule to flag any order that exceeds 5% of a portfolio’s AUM for review and validation, which, alongside portfolio-specific guidelines and restrictions, prevent immediate violations at the pre-trade stage.

The firm’s Risks & Controls manager monitors the trading activity in real-time via Bloomberg’s EMSX platform and is able to identify potential errors by reviewing live orders versus orders that were approved by the Investment Committee. A post-trade three-way review process, systematic trade matching and reconciliation ensure that the information of the firm, Broker’s and Custodian is intact and accurate. When a trading error has been identified, FIM Partners will keep the error under observation until it is possible to establish whether a profit or loss to the Client has materialized or will materialize. Where a profit arises as a consequence of the trading error and such profit is not required to be repaid to a third party, such profit will be allocated to the client in its entirety (subject to terms of the client agreement).

For errors that are the responsibility of a third party (e.g. prime brokers or executing brokers), FIM Partners will use reasonable endeavors to have them rectify the error. For errors that are caused by the gross negligence of the firm, any resulting losses above a de minimis threshold of ten bps per quarter (based upon the relevant portfolio’s average assets of the given quarter) will be borne by the firm (subject to client agreement or regulatory requirements).

## Pre-Trade and Post-Trade Checks ##
A fully integrated compliance manager utility in Bloomberg AIM is used for pre- and post-trade checks. Upon onboarding a new mandate, Bloomberg’s compliance consultants are engaged to hardcode any new rules for the portfolio. Rules are then assigned to the client profile using a maker and checker process. The rules are tested for validity on a model portfolio to ensure consistency and accuracy prior to being put in production. Once released, all trade orders are automatically passed through the compliance manager. The firm’s operational infrastructure has an embedded set of controls to monitor trade activity and identify violations throughout the trade lifecycle. Namely, orders are placed in the system by the PM and passed through the compliance engine before being sent to trader for execution. There are firm-wide rules such as a Fat Finger rule to flag any order that exceeds 5% of a portfolio’s AUM for review and validation, which, alongside portfolio-specific guidelines and restrictions, prevent immediate violations at the pre-trade stage.

Risk limits are coded into the pre-trade Compliance Module of the Bloomberg AIM OMS, so any trades which would breach these hard limits are blocked. The Risk & Controls manager monitors daily any breaches post trade (which may be driven by mark to market movements) and will immediately raise them with the PM to rectify the breach. Investment guidelines, risk limits and regulatory requirements (including the firmwide restricted list) are coded into the pre-trade Compliance Module of the Bloomberg AIM OMS, as noted above.

The Risk & Controls manager monitors daily using Bloomberg AIM any breaches post trade (which may be driven by mark to market movements) and will immediately raise them with the PM to rectify the breach. If the breach is not rectified on T+1 the Risk & Controls Manager will escalate to the COO, who will instruct the PM, or CIO as appropriate, to rectify the breach.

# IT Systems #

## Overview ##
The key applications utilized by FIM are - Bloomberg AIM (Front Office – OMS), Advent Geneva (Back Office – PMS) and Bloomberg PORT (Risk). These are discussed above.

FIM Partners does not develop its own applications. For the key applications used by FIM Partners, Bloomberg AIM and Advent Geneva, the vendors manage the code change process and notify FIM Partners in advance whenever a new version of the software is going to be released into production. The Operations team will liaise with the vendors to ensure any key changes are understood and tested prior to release as necessary. For Advent Geneva, FIM Partners also have access to a staging environment to allow for User Acceptance Testing.

# Operational Risk #

## Overview ##
The firm’s Operational Risk Manual sets forth the operational risk management policy of the firm. The methodology consists of tracking operational risk events and any financial impact associated with such events in a manner that is consistent with the operational risk events described in the Basel III framework. This also includes the recording of near misses or events which result in a positive financial outcome.

Operational risk is identified and assessed through internal and/or external loss data collection and analysis including risk assessments, business process mapping, risk and performance indicators and scenario analysis. When new products, activities, processes or systems are proposed, the following is taking into consideration:

- Inherent risks in any new product, service, or activity
- Resulting changes to FIM Partners’ operational risk profile, appetite and tolerance, including changes to the risk of existing products or activities;
- Necessary controls, risk management processes, and risk mitigation strategies;
- Residual risk;
- Changes to relevant risk limits;
- Procedures and metrics to measure, monitor, and manage the risk of the new product or activity; and,
- Appropriate investment in human resources and technology infrastructure.

The firm’s operational risk team reports on operational risk on a quarterly basis and includes the following. Material operational risk incidents are immediately reported and are logged in the Risk Register.

- Results of monitoring activities;
- Assessments of the operational risk framework performed by control functions such as internal audit, compliance, risk management and/or external audit;
- Reports generated by (and/or for) supervisory authorities;
- Material breaches of FIM Partners’ risk appetite and tolerance for operational risk;
- Details of recent significant internal operational risk events and losses, including near misses or events that resulted in a positive return; and,
- Relevant external events and any potential impact on FIM Partners and its operational risk framework, including operational risk capital.

The firm carries out an annual self-assessment of its risk and risk capital requirements by way of an Internal Risk Assessment Process (IRAP) and an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). These are subject to internal audit and regulatory reviews.
