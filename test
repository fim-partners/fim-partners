	 <p>FIM Partners was established in 2008 as among the first dedicated and independent specialist investment managers focused on the Emerging Frontier markets. The firm has successfully navigated the risks of investing in Emerging Frontier markets over the last twelve years through its fundamental approach, on the ground presence and smart portfolio construction.

As an independent firm, FIM Partners has been able to establish conservative AUM limits to size its strategies to the opportunity set for alpha generation and has never breached its capacity limits.</p>
